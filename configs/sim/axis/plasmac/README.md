#### EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS
\- metric_plasmac.ini  
\- imperial_plasmac.ini  

These example configuration files show examples of how to connect with the plasmac component for use in plasma cutting machines.  
The manual page for the plasmac component is accessed by the command 'man.plasmac'

Filename | Function
------------ | -------------
plasmac_panel.glade|a sample gladevcp panel connecting to the plasmac component.
plasmac_panel.hal|hal connections for the panel.
plasmac_panel.py|python code for the panel.
plasmac_panel.cfg|configuration settings.
plasmac_panel.mat|material file for cut parameters.
plasmac_feed.ngc|for remapping of the gcode feed rate.
plasmac_gcode.py|removes z axis moves from the opened gcode file.

The .ini files are notated for extra the requirements for these configurations.  
The minimum .ini file requirements for the plasmac component are:  
\- [PLASMAC]MODE (only if mode 1 or mode 2)  
\- [AXIS_L]MAX_VELOCITY  
\- [AXIS_L]MAX_ACCELERATION  
\- [AXIS_L]OFFSET_AV_RATIO  
All other .ini file settings are for the example configurations.  
The .cfg file is a plain text file and values may be changed with any text editor.  
The .mat file is a plain text file so may be edited with any text editor.  
Lines beginning with # are ignored in both these files.  
The python directory is for remapping of the F word.  
These configurations use the axis_tweaks file in lieu of ~/.axisrc, if you prefer to use a common ~/.axisrc file then copy the contents of axis_tweaks to your ~/.axisrc file and also comment out the line USER_COMMAND_FILE in the DISPLAY section of the ini file.  
Reverse Run allows reversing along the current segment as far as the start of the cut only while paused.  
Dry Run runs the gcode without starting the torch.

***
#### TEST PANEL

In the test directory there is a simple test panel and associated python file which can be used to test the example configuration as referenced in the ini file.

#### NGC EXAMPLES

Example ngc files are in nc_files/plasmac.
